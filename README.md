# portfolioGenerator
A Python based randomized US equity investment portfolio generator. 

This project is the basis for another project that I'm working on. It will be used to create randomized datasets that I'll use to train a deep learning program. 

Its use relatively self explanitoryâ€“ simply enter the dollar amount of the simulated portfolio, then the number of equities you want the portfolio to deversify into. Note that there may be some equities in the list that have been delisted from the NYSE.
